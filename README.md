🩺 Diabetes Prediction System 🧬
Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction System! This project uses machine learning models to predict whether a person is likely to develop diabetes based on various health indicators. It provides accurate and fast predictions using well-tuned algorithms.

🚀 Project Overview
This system leverages the power of data science to predict diabetes. By using a dataset with medical variables (e.g., blood pressure, glucose levels, insulin), various machine learning models were trained and tested to give the most reliable predictions.

✨ Features:
Multiple ML models 🧠 including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and more.

User-friendly interface 🖥️ for quick diabetes predictions.

Data preprocessing 🧹 including handling missing data, normalization, and feature selection.
Model performance evaluation 📊 using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Prediction visualization 📈.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 🐍
Pandas for data manipulation 📊
Scikit-learn for ML models 🤖
Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization 📉
